# Stock-Profit-or-Loss-Calculator

What is it?

This app is created with vanilla-JS that shows how much profit or loss we have.

How does it work?

Enter three values in the text fields, the cost price of the stock, number of stocks purchased and the current price of it. It will show if its a profit or loss by amount and percentage.
